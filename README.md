# Constrained Least Squares

I have created a Gradient Projection Method using Steepest Descent to numerically optimize minimization problems. Demonstrate this Methods effectiveness with solving Constrained Least Squares, a subclass of the minimization of residuals problem.

I also did an investigation into the Damped Spectral Square Root Preconditioning Method.

Please see the associated research paper, [Constrained Least Squares Optimizations with Damped Preconditioning Methods](Constrained_Least_Squares_Optimization.pdf) for detailed information. 

This paper also shows that controlled levels of error added to the Damped Spectral Square Root reduces the convergence rate of the Gradient Projection Method by a statistically significant factor.
